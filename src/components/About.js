			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>
				A one-stop shop full of all the right choices, Planet Organic is a health food haven with organic fruit
				& vegetables, organic bread from artisan London bakeries, only organic meat and sustainable fish from
				British waters. Our over-flowing groceries range is full of gluten-free, dairy-free, raw food and
				healthy options, while our Health & Bodycare department stocks the best natural beauty brands and a wide
				range of high quality health supplements.{' '}
			</p>

			<p>
				When we opened our doors in 1995, it was Renée Elliott's dream to offer the best and widest range of
				organic foods available, and her mission to promote health in the community and to bring a sense of
				discovery and adventure into food shopping. As most food production becomes increasingly industrialised,
				we want to bring back a sense of food that you can trust.
			</p>

			<h3>What We Believe</h3>
			<p>
				Our simple truth is that foods should be natural and wholesome. We advocate that food be authentic and
				ethical, freshly prepared and tasty – not a mere convenience. We believe in ethical and sustainable
				farming and place great emphasis on the provenance of all our products.
			</p>

			<p>
				We know that people who are discerning about what they eat want to make informed and responsible
				choices. Like us you believe that food wasn’t meant to be meddled with or tainted with chemicals. So we
				say no to artificial additives, hydrogenated fats, highly processed foods, and of course GM. Instead at
				Planet Organic you’ll find nutritious, seasonal and organic food with the goodness intact. You’ll find
				wide ranges of natural health foods suitable for all speciality diets, as well as a ground-breaking raw
				foods range.
			</p>

			<p>
				We hope that you find inspiration, excitement and good health from the food you eat and learn, like us,
				that to eat well is to live better.
